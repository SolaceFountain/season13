Each player has to submit their answers for Q1 to Q7 in their own private decisions channel by the <strong>deadline (10 AM EST tomorrow)</strong>. 
Points will be scored based on how popular your answer is. For example, if you answered &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; for Q1 and 4 survey respondents gave the same answer, you would contribute 4 points to your tribe. Your goal as a tribe is to win as many points as possible.

You are allowed to discuss with your tribemates for this challenge. In fact, you&#39;re highly encouraged to work together because duplicate answers within your tribe will not be given points. For example, if you and one of your tribemates both answered &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; for Q1, only 4 points will be rewarded, instead of 8 points. So we would suggest you to coordinate with your tribemates to come up with 4 distinct set of answers for Q1 to Q6. In case of a tie in total points between 2 or more tribes, we would look at the tribes&#39; average answer for Q7 and see which tribe got it closest to the actual answer for Q7.

Deadline to post your individual answers in your decisions channel (and react to your final submission with a ⭐) is <strong>10 AM (EST)</strong> tomorrow (about 23 hours from now) and we target to announce the results by 11 AM (EST).

Hope this is clear. If not, feel free to ask us to clarify. Have fun and good luck!</span>

We have been looking forward to this as well as it&#39;s another $urvivor first. Remember <span class="mention">#rules</span> 3.1 ? Last time I was crazy, this time I am still as crazy...

Yes we have heard you. We know how scary it must be to be in a tiny tribe of four. Don&#39;t worry as you aren&#39;t staying in your current tribe for long. This first immunity challenge is called &quot;Family $eparation&quot; because after family feud, your family of four is about to be separated into 2 halves!

This challenge is very simple: you are to <strong>bid off</strong> against your current tribemates to win yourself individual immunity! The top 2 bidders of each tribe will win immunity and join a new tribe of 10 called <span class="mention" style="color: #FF8333; background-color: rgba(255, 131, 51, 0.1); font-weight: 400;">@Pranayama (प्राणायाम)</span>  while the bottom 2 of each tribe will join the other tribe of 10 called <span class="mention" style="color: #33AFFF; background-color: rgba(51, 175, 255, 0.1); font-weight: 400;">@Virasana (वीरासन)</span>  to attend the first tribal council of the season where one of the Virasana members will become the first person voted out of this game!</span>

Alright after you have calmed down, please read the following points that you need to consider when deciding how much to bid for safety here:

<div class="quote">1) You have to spend <strong>a minimum of $1</strong> in this challenge. </div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">2) And there is a <strong>maximum</strong> amount on how much you could spend as well in this challenge. You can only spend <strong>up to the amount of money you were rewarded</strong> from the &quot;family feud&quot; reward challenge. So if you received $1,300 in the reward challenge, you could only bid up to $1,300 here.</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">3) Try to avoid bidding the exact same amount as your tribemates because if there is a tie for any placement in your tribe (let&#39;s say the 2nd and 3rd highest bidders in Tribe A both bid $100), the tie will be broken by a random draw. However we strongly advise against letting <span class="mention" title="Miki#6045">@$urvivor Goddess</span> decide your fate as we have a fine system where <strong>if you bid the same amount</strong> as at least one of your tribemates, you will incur <strong>a fine of $1,300</strong>. So let&#39;s hope you don&#39;t somehow end up bidding the same amount as your tribemates.</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">4) Your individual bid amounts will <strong>NOT</strong> be revealed, only your placement of bidding within your tribe will be.</div>&gt; 
<div class="quote">5) Deadline: You have until <strong>11:11 AM (EST)</strong> tomorrow (Feb 25th) to lock in your bid amount in your decisions channel. Better make a wish! No one wants to go home first right? </div><div class="quote"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Bid amount for immunity: [ $_____ ]</div></div></span>

<u><strong>Final 19 Immunity Challenge</strong></u>

Today&#39;s challenge is called <strong>Battle @ Temple</strong> where each tribe has to form 3 groups of 3 to bid off against the opposing tribe in their respective bidding battles to score a point for their tribe. As Pranayama has one extra member, they have to choose one person to sit out. Meghan has been selected by her tribe to sit out and sent to visit Temple of Temptation while this challenge is on-going. (No private communication with Meghan while she is on ToT.)

Based on the groups formed, we have:
<div class="quote">Battle 01: Benj, Best, Disc vs Erik, Logan, Coffee</div><div class="quote">Battle 02: Emily, Jazz, Jon vs Gwen, Josh, Vulture</div><div class="quote">Battle 03: Noah, Tom, Tottzi vs Highspace, Charan, Celtics</div>
Whichever tribe with more points will win immunity and safe from tribal council. 
As usual, <strong>individual bids will not be revealed</strong>. 
We will only reveal the <strong>total</strong> for your whole tribe (sum from all groups).

Min bid is $1 per person.
If there is a tie for a match, both sides will score 0 point for their tribe.
If there is a 1-1 tie for total score, we will check which tribe spent more overall.

Deadline is <strong>11:30 PM (EST)</strong>, Feb 27th 2020. 
<em>(Could move the cycle earlier if all bids can be submitted before then)</em></span>

                    <span class="markdown">This challenge is simply called <strong>Me vs We</strong> as all of you are about to face with our classic moral dilemma that has been featured in many past $easons since $eason 5 ($iberia). 

Here&#39;s how it&#39;s gonna work. All of you have an individual choice to make: <strong>choose to either bid for tribal immunity idol for your tribe or individual immunity necklace</strong> by heading Temple of Temptation to guarantee your OWN safety in the game. There is one necklace available for each tribe.

You CANNOT bid for both.  
So if you decide to bid say $1,000 for tribal immunity, your bid for individual immunity would be zero, vice versa. 
You have to spend at least $1 for this challenge, either on the &quot;we&quot; option (tribal immunity) or &quot;me&quot; option (individual immunity)

Please post your answers to the following two questions in your private decisions channel by <strong>11:00 AM (EST)</strong> tomorrow. 
<div class="quote"><strong>1) Are you bidding for tribal or individual immunity?</strong></div><div class="quote"><strong>2) How much are you spending for it?</strong></div><em> </em></span>

(If you do want to donate your real money, here&#39;s the link: <a href="https://support.wwfindia.org/)">https://support.wwfindia.org/)</a> For example, if you have $40,002 left in the game after bidding for this challenge and everyone in your tribe bid at least $1 for tribal immunity, you will have a further $2,000 (rounded to nearest dollar amount) deducted from your account, regardless if your tribe end up winning immunity or not. This 5% deduction is not counted as additional bid for tribal immunity.</div></span>

                    <span class="markdown">It&#39;s time to shake things up! Tribal immunity idol is not up for bids today. Instead you&#39;re competing against your tribemates in today&#39;s immunity challenge (: 

After this challenge, 3 members from each tribe will be attending a 6-person joint tribal council this round! Doesn&#39;t it sound fun and exciting?! But judging by what happened last $eason for a similar twist, we would strongly advise against volunteering to risk your life in this game at the joint tribal council.

So which 3 from your tribe will be sacrificed <s>as tributes</s> to attend it? It shall be determined by the outcome of this immunity challenge called <strong>The Liquidation Game</strong>. 

The 6 &quot;lucky&quot; players that attend the joint tribal will be able to DM other attendees of the joint tribal regardless of which tribe they are from. (This is a rare exception where we allow cross-tribe private communication during a joint tribal council).

                    <span class="markdown">Immunity is back up for grabs after a fun $wap yesterday! Today&#39;s challenge is called <strong>Greed</strong>. And nope it&#39;s not the greed challenge that you may have seen in other ORGs lately. Ours here literally tests you how greedy you are when it comes to money and tribal immunity.

Feeling like you may have been spending too much in the first five rounds? Needing a monetary boost in your balance? This could be the perfect challenge for you, depending on how safe you feel you are in your new tribe...

For this challenge, we are offering all of you the temptation to grab up to $5,200 for yourself, instead of spending money for tribal immunity. It’s up to yourself to <strong>decide how much money you want to take for your own account</strong> at the expense of your tribe. The <strong>minimum</strong> amount to take from the fresh fund is <strong>$1</strong> and the <strong>maximum</strong> is <strong>$5,200</strong> per player.</span>

                    <span class="markdown"><em> </em>
What’s the catch? Well, the more money you take away from your tribe, the more likely your tribe will be going to tribal council.  The tribe with the <strong>lower average amount of money taken</strong> by its own members will <strong>win immunity</strong>. If there was a tie for the average amount, standard deviation of the individual amounts taken would be used to break the tie where lower standard deviation would win. If there was a tie in both total and standard deviation (for example when all players on both tribes chose to take the min amount $1), a random rock draw by <span class="mention" title="Miki#6045">@$urvivor Goddess</span> would be used.

Another catch to note is that <strong>if the average amount of money taken away by your tribe exceeds $2,600, all the money taken by everyone in your tribe would be voided</strong>. So you may want to think twice before getting too greedy or you and your tribemates would all end up getting no money and still lose immunity.

All individual decisions for this challenge will <strong>NOT</strong> be revealed. We will only reveal the average amount of money taken for each tribe and the standard deviation for each tribe. You are free to discuss privately with your tribemates on how much you’re thinking to take and more than welcome to use <span class="mention">#final-15-immunity</span> to negotiate openly with the other tribe.

Fun fact from last $eason when we first had this challenge: 2 guys took nearly the maximum they could take; Sean was blindsided after losing this challenge and Dan went on to win the game!

Hope it&#39;s all clear. Any questions or doubts, please ask.

<strong>Decision deadline: 9:30 AM (EST)</strong> tomorrow.</span>

As informed yesterday to allow you all to get prepared, every single one of you is heading to Tribal Council <strong>together</strong> but remain as two tribes! 

Final 14 Immunity Challenge is to be held at Tribal Council as <strong>BOTH TRIBES have to vote against one of their own tribe members while simultaneously competing in the tribal immunity challenge</strong> where results of the challenge will only be revealed after votes have been cast!** 

There are two parts to this immunity challenge: 

<u>Part 1: Bid</u>
<div class="quote">• You have to decide how much you want to bid to help your tribe to win tribal immunity. </div><div class="quote">• Minimum is $1. </div><div class="quote">• Your individual bid will be deducted from your balance and it shall remain confidential.</div><div class="quote">• Only the average bid for each tribe will be revealed.&#160;</div>
<u>Part 2: Guesstimate</u>
<div class="quote">• You have to guesstimate the average amount bid by the opposing tribe for Part 1.</div><div class="quote">• Your individual guesstimate WILL be revealed. It will be used to calculate the average guesstimate submitted by your tribe.</div><div class="quote">• This average guesstimate will then be compared with the actual average bid of the opposing tribe to measure how close your guesstimate is to the actual.</div><div class="quote">• Whichever tribe with a more accurate guess to how much the other tribe bid on average would win a boost of 13% to the amount they bid in Part 1. </div><em> </em></span>

            </div>
            <div class="chatlog__message " data-message-id="686595273392128025" id="message-686595273392128025">
                <div class="chatlog__content">
                    <span class="markdown"><u>Example:</u>
The average bid for Tribe P in Part 1 is $1,000.
The average bid for Tribe V in Part 1 is $1,100.

On average Tribe P guesstimate that Tribe V bid $2,000 for Part 1.
On average Tribe V guesstimate that Tribe P bid $3,000 for Part 1.

Tribe P made a more acccurate guess than Tribe V (2000-1100 vs 3000-1000) and thus their average bid for Part 1 would get a 13% boost. 
Tribe P&#39;s amount that counts towards winning immunity would be $1,130 while Tribe V&#39;s amount remain at $1,100.
In this example, Tribe P would win tribal immunity ($1,130 &gt; $1,100) and the votes they had cast in this tribal council WOULD NOT BE READ.
Tribe V&#39;s votes against each other would be read right after the immunity results had been announced.

Remember, during this &quot;live&quot; tribal council, you can only send up to 20 private messages to anyone in the Final 14 via the whisper system as explained in <span class="mention">#final-14-whispers-log</span>. Each whisper would cost you $130, to be deducted from your game balance.

In summary, all 14 of you have to submit 3 things in your private decisions channel by <strong>11:00AM (EDT), Mar 10th 2020</strong>:
<div class="quote">1) Bid for tribal immunity</div><div class="quote">2) Guess the average bid submitted by the opposing tribe</div><div class="quote">3) Cast a vote against one of your tribemates  (your vote will only be read if your tribe lost immunity)</div>
Any questions please ask us. Have fun!</span>

<u><strong>Final 13 Individual Reward Challenge</strong></u>

<span class="mention" style="color: #25C059; background-color: rgba(37, 192, 89, 0.1); font-weight: 400;">@$ikkim</span> Isn&#39;t it nice to make it to merge right after tribal? (Something I hope to see one day on TV where they announce merge to the cast right after they&#39;re done with the last pre-merge tribal) Congrats on making merge! First business to do once merged is to get you all to <strong>come up with a name for your new tribe</strong>. 

We appreciate how it&#39;s hard to get all 13 of you to agree on a name for the merged tribe given how everyone has their own preference. Some players in the past did not like that they never got the chance to have their inputs as it&#39;s already decided when they got online. So instead of doing that, we make naming the merged tribe a reward challenge here.

Your task today is a simple and fun one. Each one of you needs <strong>to nominate one name for your merged tribe anonymously in your decision channels by 11 AM EDT, Mar 11th 2020</strong>. 

Once we have got all 13 suggested names, we would post them in <span class="mention">#fan-fav-poll&#128525;</span> to let <s>AMERICA</s> our lovely  @ $pectators vote on them without letting them know who suggested which name to avoid bias. As soon as we have a clear winner we will inform you what your merged tribe name will be. If you came up with the name with the highest number of upvotes, you would have <strong>$2,600</strong> added to your account in private as your reward.  As we&#39;re feeling generous, the name that received the second highest number of upvotes would win <strong>$1,300</strong>. It&#39;ll be up to the reward winners to decide if they want to let everyone know that they just got richer.

Fast forward to this round, you&#39;re once again put into a tribe of 4 and this time you have no choice but to attend tribal council with your new small tribe! 

<em>gasps</em>

After this immunity challenge, all 3 tribes will be going to tribal council tonight separately. One player from each tribe will be voted to go to <strong>Temple of Temptation</strong>. You DO NOT want to go to Temple of Temptation this round because there is a high chance you may not get back into the game from ToT. Details of what will happen at ToT will only be informed to those 3 voted to be there. The only thing I could tell now is that idols or any other game advantages you may have won&#39;t be usable at ToT.

From now on until the end of this immunity challenge, all 12 of you are stuck here at this challenge field and <span class="mention">#final-12-immunity</span> is the only channel you can communicate with each other. <strong>Please do not communicate privately with anyone</strong> including your 3 tribemates via DM, VC, reactions or alliance chats. You all will have time to talk with your tribemates once you&#39;re at your respective tribal council.

Before we get to tribal council, you all stand a chance to win this individual immunity necklace. If you want no risk at all from being screwed by the unexpected twist, I would suggest you to bid high for this one and only necklace available this round. Yes, even though you&#39;re divided into 3 tribes of 4, only the overall highest bidder will win immunity.

<u><strong>Final 11 Immunity Challenge</strong></u>

You may have expected the demerge twist would only last for one round but in reality it’d be 1.5 rounds as you will be bidding as a tribe of 3 (<strong>Ashta 2.0 vs Ekam 2.0 vs Naka 2.0</strong>) for this immunity challenge before everyone in the Final 11 is re-merged to the $araswati tribe to attend Tribal Council together.

It’s very straightforward. Whichever <strong>tribe with the highest total bids</strong> will win immunity! Each member of the winning tribe will win an immunity necklace, guaranteeing themselves a spot in the Final 10! As <strong>Charan and Noah </strong>are currently tribeless, they don’t get a chance to bid for immunity here. Instead, they will just be sitting at the sit-out bench and watch by the sideline.

Individual bids won’t be revealed for this challenge, neither will be your tribe’s total. We will reveal the ranking from highest to lowest bidding tribe and the total amount bid by the 9 of you who are taking part in this challenge. Tie, if any, will be broken by random. Minimum bid is $1 as usual.

You’re free to strategize for this challenge with anyone left in the game and appreciate if you could lock in your individual bid in your private decision channel by <strong>11:00 AM (EDT)</strong> tomorrow. Good luck!</span>

<u><strong>Final 10 Immunity Challenge</strong></u>

<span class="mention" style="color: #25C059; background-color: rgba(37, 192, 89, 0.1); font-weight: 400;">@$ikkim</span> Today we&#39;re having our favourite old-$chool immunity challenge: <strong>Touchy $ubjects</strong>!

This challenge is to be done as soon as possible. As long as you have a few minutes to spare, please complete this challenge <strong>WITHOUT discussing about it at all with anyone</strong> else. There are 2 parts to this challenge. To win immunity, your goal is to score as many points as possible from both parts.

Part I is on <strong>bidding</strong>:
<div class="quote">• How many points you score from this part depends on your bid ranking/ The highest bidder will score 13 points, the second highest bidder will get 11 points, 3rd will get 9 points, 4th will get 7 points, 5th - 6 points, 6th - 5 points and following this pattern the lowest bidder will get only 1 point. </div><div class="quote">• You have to bid at least $1 and you are <strong>not allowed to discuss</strong> with others how much you bid for this part of the challenge. </div><div class="quote">• Your individual bid amount won&#39;t be revealed but your ranking for this part and the combined amount spent by all 10 of you will be revealed. </div><div class="quote">• If there is a tie for any position, they will share the lower position. For example, if there are 3 players who bid the lowest (at say $1), they will all get 1 point each.</div>
Part II is on <strong>majority rules</strong>.
<div class="quote">• There are 13 questions in total (as listed below). Your task is to choose an answer that you think the <strong>majority</strong> would put for each question. </div><div class="quote">• If your answer is in majority, you would score a point. </div><div class="quote">• If it&#39;s in minority, you would gain zero point.</div><div class="quote">• Tied answers would all consider to be in majority for the record. For example, if the question was who is the best ho$t and 3 of you answered Lord, 3 answered Light, 3 answered Fish and 1 on Scarlet, 9 players would score a point from this question.</div><div class="quote">• We will reveal what the majority put as answer for each question without revealing any individual submissions.</div><div class="quote">• Your points for Part II will be revealed. </div><em> </em></span>

                </div>

                    <span class="markdown">Your points from Part I &amp; II will be added up. Whoever with the <strong>highest total points will win the immunity necklace</strong>, guarantee a single digit placement! If there is a tie, bids submitted for Part I will be used to break it. If it&#39;s still a tie, it&#39;d be broken by a random rock draw.

Please submit your bid for Part I and answer for Part II in your private decisions channel as soon as you have 10 minutes or so to spare. Hard deadline is <strong>10:30 AM (EDT) tomorrow</strong> but as there is <strong>no strategising allowed</strong>, there should be no game related reason to drag it out to 24 hours. Remember, any form of communication about the challenge is totally not allowed. We may update who has/hasn&#39;t done the challenge and will try to get the results out as soon as everyone has submitted. No discussion with anyone even after you have completed it until results have been announced.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Part 1: I bid [ $___ ]. (min: $1)

Part 2: Answer who you think the majority would put down for each question. You must write down the name of one of your tribemates or yourself next to each question, except for Question 10 that asks for a name of a pre-juror.

1) Who is the most trustworthy player? 
2) Who is the biggest snake?
3) Who is playing the best social game?
4) Who is the most boring to chat with?
5) Who is the most strategic player?
6) Who is most likely to be blindsided next?
7) Who is perceived as the richest player left in the game?
8) Who is perceived as the poorest player left in the game?
9) Who needs to win this immunity challenge the most?
10) Who is the most robbed pre-juror?
11) Who is most likely to be a wholesome juror?
12) Who is most likely going to float to the end?
13) Who is most likely to become the $ole $urvivor?</div></span>

                    <span class="markdown">Earlier you have all been asked to choose a tile. What&#39;s it for? 

Well, this challenge is called <strong>&quot;The Reverse $choolyard Pick</strong>. It was predetermined at our <span class="mention">#bot  playground&#129302;</span>  channel that the player who picked the only yellow tile on the 3x3 board (middle right tile) would be our &quot;lucky&quot; captain to get this challenge going.

Gwen got a good taste in choosing it but I quoted &quot;lucky&quot; because she won&#39;t be eligible to win this one and only immunity necklace available this round AND she now has an important decision to make in public (at <span class="mention">#s13-saraswati</span>) asap: to pick one tribemate that she wants to sit out if this challenge with her. The player picked by Gwen will then proceed to pick another player publicly to join them on the sit-out bench. The person picked will continue this chain until we have got 7 players sitting out of this challenge, leaving us with only two castaways left unpicked to face off against each other for immunity.

Please note that from now on, all forms of private communication is now blocked. Please <strong>do NOT contact anyone in the game privately via DMs and whatnots until the pick&#39;em chain has been completed</strong> and we know which two players will stand a chance to win immunity.

You are only free to interact with one another at <span class="mention">#s13-saraswati</span> during this period.</span>

<u><strong>Final 8 Immunity Challenge</strong></u>

After 4 weeks into the game, it&#39;s time for you to get all the love you deserve. Today&#39;s challenge is called <strong>$cattergories of Love</strong>! 

There are two parts to it: 

Part I is for the <span class="mention" style="color: #25C059; background-color: rgba(37, 192, 89, 0.1); font-weight: 400;">@$ikkim</span>, you simply have to decide how much you want to spend to increase your chance of winning immunity. <strong>Minimum is $10</strong> for this challenge. 

How much of your spending for this challenge will actually count towards immunity will depend on your loved one&#39;s performance in the second part of the challenge. 

Part II is for <span class="mention" style="color: #E91E63; background-color: rgba(233, 30, 99, 0.1); font-weight: 400;">@$14 Loved Ones&#128149;</span>, for each of the following 10 categories, you will have to come up with a <strong>unique</strong> answer that none of the other 7 loved one&#39;s choose in order for 10% of spending in Part I to count. For example, your partner spent $1,300 in Part I of this challenge and you got 8 unique answers, 80% of their spending ($1,040) would count towards winning immunity. The 10 categories are listed below:

<strong><div class="quote">1) An animal that starts with the letter i</div><div class="quote">2) A currency symbol</div><div class="quote">3) A compound nouns formed with “light” (flashlight, lighthouse, etc.)</div><div class="quote">4) A word to complete this sentence: &quot;Love is [ ___ ].&quot; (one word only)</div><div class="quote">5) A player that made Final 8 in $urvivor 13: $ikkim (Temple of Temptation)</div><div class="quote">6) A number from 1 to 10 (integer only, no decimal place)</div><div class="quote">7) A current $urvivor host</div><div class="quote">8) An item that you save up to buy that starts with S</div><div class="quote">9) A deadly sin (out of the seven deadly sins: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, pride)</div><div class="quote">10) A word associated with money</div></strong>

Final 8, <span class="mention" style="color: #25C059; background-color: rgba(37, 192, 89, 0.1); font-weight: 400;">@$ikkim</span>  while your individual bids won&#39;t be revealed, your performance in the challenge will be ranked based on how much of your spending counts towards immunity. For example, Player A spent $100 and his loved one got 8 unique answers, his final dollar amount for immunity would be $80 (80%x*100). Player B spent $200 but B&#39;s loved one only scored 3 in Part II, then his final amount for immunity would be $60 (30%x200). And B would be ranked lower than A when we reveal the challenge without revealing how much they spent individually.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Immunity is back up for grabs. Today you&#39;re playing for &quot;<strong>Photographs</strong>&quot;. In front of you, there are 13 photos of the players you have outlasted so far in the game and they&#39;re COMING BACK to haunt you!

Here&#39;s how it&#39;s gonna work: Each photo of a voted player is assigned a point value based on the order they were eliminated from the game. For example, Matthew is the first boot and thus his photo is worth 1 point; second boot Tottzi is 2 points, etc. You get to win the points attached to a photo by placing the highest <strong>unique</strong> bid among the Final 7. Your goal to win immunity is to accumulate as many points as possible because the player with the most points will win the immunity necklace, guaranteeing a one-in-six shot of winning this game.

For this challenge, there is no minimum bid. If you&#39;re feeling safe or wanting to save money for the future rounds, you are free to bid $0 for all photos. But no one could feel more safe than having the immunity necklace around your neck.

There are some <strong>important conditions</strong> you need to take note of when placing your bids for the photographs:
<div class="quote">• You can only <strong>bid in multiples of $100</strong> up to a <strong>maximum of $1,300</strong> per photograph.</div><div class="quote">• In other words, for each of the 13 photographs, you decide to bid $0, $100, $200, $300,...,$1200 or $1300.</div><div class="quote">• For each photo, points will be awarded to the bidder with highest <strong>unique</strong> bid. This means that if two or more players tied for the highest bid for a photo, they all won&#39;t win it and the next highest unique bidder would get it. </div><div class="quote">• For example, if Player A and B both bid $1,000 for Erik&#39;s photo (which is worth 12 points as he&#39;s the 12th boot), C bid $800 and everyone else bid $700 or lower, Player C would win the 12 points attached to Erik&#39;s photo.</div><em> </em></span>

                    <span class="markdown">With only 6 of you left. The stake of winning immunity is higher than before!

However, if you are feeling good about your position in the game and would rather boost your <s>rice</s> money balance left in the game instead of having a shot at winning a <strong>non-money</strong> based individual immunity challenge, there is this one-off monetary temptation being offered:

You have each been given a <strong>black rock</strong> and a <strong>white rock</strong>. 

If you choose to sit out from this immunity challenge in order to earn up to $7,200 potentially, please type <span class="pre pre--inline">!white_rock</span> here now. You can&#39;t discuss about your decision with anyone else and not allowed to change your decision once you have decided.

How much you would earn if you chose to openly sit out would be based on how many players chose to take this temptation. <strong>The offered cash of $7,200</strong> would be shared equally by the number of players who are feeling safe enough to go for the extra money. If you&#39;re the only one who sits out, you get the whole $7,200. If all six chose to sit out, each would get $1,200 and no one would be immune this round. 

If you choose to participate in the <strong>non-money based</strong> immunity challenge, please type <span class="pre pre--inline">!black_rock</span> here now to find out the details of the challenge. You can&#39;t change your decision once you have posted the command. 

Please use only one of the 2 commands. Failing to do so will incur a large penalty.  So please choose either black or white rock. Good luck with your decision!

Also note that you are NOT allowed to discuss about your decision with anyone else in the game until we have announced all 6 individual decisions.</span>

<u><strong>Final 5 Immunity Challenge</strong></u>

Once again, immunity is back up for grabs! Today you&#39;re playing for &quot;As Long As I Ain&#39;t Last&quot;. Ideally, this challenge should be done live if all five of you could be online at the same time. It&#39;d be more fun this way and it should end within 30 minutes. But due to timezone differences, this may not be possible until 3am my time  So I will just post the details here and you can submit your private decisions asap without discussing with anyone privately.

Here&#39;s how it&#39;s gonna work: there are a total of 3 bidding rounds where the lowest bidder in each round will be eliminated. We will start with 5 players in the first round and after 3 rounds, only 2 will remain in the challenge. Their total spending across 3 rounds will then be compared and the player who has spent <strong>less</strong> in total will win immunity to guarantee a spot in the Final 4!

So, while you want to make sure you aren&#39;t the lowest bidder in each round to avoid elimination, you also have to be mindful not to overspend since the player who makes it through the 3 rounds with less total spending will be the winner of this immunity challenge.

Any tie involved in this challenge will be broken by a random draw. Minimum bid for each round is $1.

Private communication in any form with others about this challenge is not allowed. You may only use your camp chat to negotiate with each other publicly.

Please read through the instructions carefully and complete the challenge within the next 39 minutes. (Time started from when this command response is posted in your decision channel.)

<u>Part 1: Immunity Advantage</u>
Firstly, you have to decide how much you are pouring into this challenge to give yourself an edge over your tribemates. Whatever amount you put in here will be deducted from your account balance. The player with the highest spending will have 100% of their total points from Part 2 to 4 counted towards immunity. The 2nd highest spender will have 90% of their points counted. 3rd will have 80% and the lowest bidder will have 70% of their points counted towards immunity.

For example, if Player A spent the lowest in Part 1 of this challenge and scored a total of 40 points from Part 2 to 4 (maximum possible point is 70), their final score for immunity would be 28.0 (70%*40).

All clear? If so, please post here now on how much you want to spend and then enter <span class="pre pre--inline">!part2</span> to proceed to the next part of the challenge. Please note that the amount you have decided cannot be changed once you have moved on to Part 2.</span>

Your task here is to list down whom you think they gave their legacy of love to. Please name the two recipients of legacy from each eliminated player. For each correct recipient, you will score one point. Maximum points you could score from this part: 32 points (2x16).

1) Matthew bequeathed to [ ] and [ ].

Remember being asked in your first public confessionals on Day 1 what your favorite animal is? Here you get to have a little bit of fun to make your best guess on each juror&#39;s favorite animal. You would score 3 points for each correct answer. Max possible points: 24 (3x8)

If you feel like it&#39;s too hard to make wild guesses out of so many possible animals, would you be tempted to spend an additional $2,600 to narrow down the options to 13 animal species? If yes and you do still have more than $2,600 in your game account (after deducting what you have spent in Part 1 of this challenge), you can type <span class="pre pre--inline">!hint_animals</span> to get the narrowed list of possible answers to help you in this part.

1) Tom&#39;s favorite animal is [ ].	
2) Best&#39;s favorite animal is [ ].
3) Noah&#39;s favorite animal is [ ].
4) Erik&#39;s favorite animal is [ ].
5) Jon&#39;s favorite animal is [ ].
6) Meghan&#39;s favorite animal is [ ].
7) Josh&#39;s favorite animal is [ ].
8) Charan&#39;s favorite animal is [ ].

Once you&#39;re done with this final part, that&#39;s it! We will reveal the results once all four of you have done the challenge. Good luck!</span>

<u><strong>Final 4 Fire Making Challenge</strong></u>

Benj and HighSpace, this is a challenge that you will have to do it on your own without getting help from anyone else. It can be done on mobile or PC. It shouldn&#39;t matter.

<s>Fire</s> Money represents your life in $urvivor. Have you been practicing your <s>fire making</s> money tracking skill? Now your life in the game depends on it. 

There are two parts to this tie breaking challenge. Part 1 is on outbidding your opponent and Part 2 is on making your best guesstimate.

<span class="pre pre--inline">Part 1: Advantage</span>
First, you have to decide how much you are bidding for a 10% advantage in Part 2.

The player with the higher bidding amount will get 10% off the difference between his submitted guesstimate and the actual answer.   

<span class="pre pre--inline">Part 2: Guesstimate</span>
Please make your best guesstimate to this question based on information that you have been gathering and tracking in this game.

What is the total amount of money held by the 16 eliminated players (from 20th placer to the 5th placer) as of the point when they were eliminated from the game? 

Your goal is to come up with a guesstimate that is as close as possible to the actual amount. For the higher bidder in Part 1, the difference between his guesstimate and the actual number will be multiplied by 90% due to the &quot;10% off&quot; advantage. It will then be compared against the difference between the lower bidder&#39;s guesstimate and the actual answer. Whoever with a lower difference after factoring in the advantage from Part 1 will win this tie-breaking challenge and join Gwen and Vulture in the Final 3!

Please post your bid amount for part 1 and guesstimate for part 2 within the next 90 minutes. Once you have starred them, they&#39;re locked in. Good luck, Benj and HighSpace!</span>

<u><strong>Final 3 Reward Challenge</strong></u>

Our 4th placer of this $eason, Benj was given the legacy power to decide if we would have a Final Tribal Council with 2 or 3 finalists. He chose the Final 3 format for FTC, making the final challenge to be for a potential game changing reward instead of immunity. Whoever wins this final reward challenge gets to grant one of our nine jury members an extra vote to cast at FTC.

Here&#39;s how it&#39;s gonna work: there are 13 $tatuettes in total that you have had to bid for on one by one live. In each round, whoever that bid the highest would win the statuette.  The player with the most number of statuettes after 13 rounds would win the extra jury vote reward. If there was a tie, whoever among the tied players that spent the least amount of money in total would win. 

After the first round, the challenge would continue with the second and so on until it&#39;s confirmed that one of the Final 3 had secured the most number of statuettes.

All individual bids for each round will be revealed before we proceed to the next one. No private discussion is allowed during this live challenge. 

Good luck <span class="mention" style="color: #25C059; background-color: rgba(37, 192, 89, 0.1); font-weight: 400;">@$ikkim</span>!</span>
